### Strategy

The main goal of this e-commerce website is to be a place where people who wants to buy digital art, will be able to do it. The users will also be able to comment what they think about different pieces and therefore it will create a sort of community feeling. Users will be able to add their favorite pieces to their profile if they want to save something for later.

Project goals: 

- Design a website which do not take away from the art pieces themselves, should be very simple with minimal approach
- Present an easy and smooth experience for users to buy digital art pieces, from finding a piece until paying for it

## Testing 

I have done a lot of testing throughout the project and below you will find it in a more structured manner. I have made sure that the user stories are tested and works well, also focused on responsiveness where I have used resources online as well as the physical devices I had access to. Whenever a new functionality of the site was implemented, I tested it. At the end of the development journey, I had a big testing day where I went through the sites full functionality again.

### Tests done in order to secure UI components

| Test | Method | Expected | Result |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Log In | ------ | -------- | ------ |

### Tests done in order to secure structural integrity

#### Modals

Each modal implemented on the website was tested on several screen sizes and confirmed that it kept its responsive design.

This includes the modals for:

- Log in
- Sign up
- Add artist

#### Fonts

Fonts are consistent throughout the website, this was checked by simply controlling each part of the website with chrome dev tools.

### Testing forms + Post & Get to/from DB

As the website rely heavily on its forms for both user authentication as well as adding and editing artist cards, extensive testing on them was made. 

#### Login 
Tested by:
- entering correct login info and logging in, got the data correctly from DB everytime
- entering incorrect login info and trying to login
- entering nothing and trying to login

#### Sign Up
Tested by:
- entering new user information and click sign up, posted the information correctly to DB everytime
- entering already existing user information, got the already registered user information everytime
- entering nothing and trying to sign up


#### Add Artist 
Tested by:
- entering new artist information and click add, posted the information correctly to DB everytime
- entering already existing artist information, function for get in this case is still under development
- tested leaving fields empty to see that it did not work to add

#### Edit Artist 
Tested by:
- changing one field and click add, updated the data in DB everytime
- changing fields and click cancel, did not change anything

### Bugs

| Bug | Solution | Current status |
| --- | -------- | -------------- |
| Connection to MongoDB stopped working after changing geolocation from Japan to Sweden | Solved by creating a new cluster with the server based in Germany instead of Singapore | Solved |
| When searching for an artist the error message "pymongo.errors.OperationFailure" shows up | Solved by creating a new search index via the CLI which was missed when creating a new cluster | Solved |
| Logo does not show on profile page | Solved by adding a "url_for" in order to get the picture instead of a direct path | Solved |
| Genre dropdown in modal for add artist does not generate any options | Solved by adding a get method to get genres from db in the "get_artist" function | Solved |
| Login forms fields are difficult to mark and fill in | Solved by adding "pointer-events: none" directly to html | Solved |
| Styling of alert box disappeared | Solved by moving the style class to the correct div | Solved |


### Browser and screen size responsiveness testing

Have done extensive testing in Chrome DevTools, different browsers as well as on physical devices I had access to. The website is responsive and it acts as it is supposed to when changing between devices, browsers and screen sizes.

**Websites used for testing on different screen sizes (other than what is mentioned above):**

- [whatismyscreenresolution.net](http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/multi-screen-test)
- [responsivetesttool.com](http://responsivetesttool.com/)

### HTML Validator (W3C Markup) - [Link](https://validator.w3.org)

Pushed my HTML code through the validator and got following messages which I corrected:

| Message | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Attribute a not allowed on element a at this point | Solved by removing one "a" in the tag as it accidentally was two of them |
| Character reference was not terminated by a semicolon | Solved by adding ";" to the end of the emojis |
| An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions. | Solved by adding alt that was missing |

**IMPORTANT!** Because I am using the jinja templating language in this app, there is bound to show a lot of warnings and errors connected to that. These warnings and errors have been checked and controlled and are deemed to be safe to disregard as they are not true errors for the application.

### CSS Validator (W3C CSS) - [Link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)

Pushed my CSS code through the validator and got following messages which I corrected:

| Message | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Value Error background-color 'none' is not a background-color value 'none' | Solved by adding 'transparent' instead of 'none' |

Also received a few warnings including for the variables created in CSS, I decide to disregard these warnings as I am confident that they do not pose any error for the website.

### JSHint - [Link](https://jshint.com/)

Pushed my JavaScript code through JSHint where no major issues showed up.

| Message | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| No relevant warnings and no errors showing. | - |

The report shows that there are several undefined variables '$', this is caused by using jQuery and therefore we can disregard them.

### PEP8 - [Link](http://pep8online.com/)

Pushed my Python code through PEP8 where only a few minor issues showed up, such as whitespace where it should not be. Everything is now solved and it does not show any issues anymore. 

| Message | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| No relevant warnings and no errors showing. | - |

### User stories result

All of the testing and debugging above have left us with the result below on achieving the goal of our user stories listed in the top of this readme:

| User story | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| User friendly layout | PASS |
| Register account, add, edit & delete artists | PASS |
| Preview of artists before signing up | PASS |
| Users posts gathered on profile page | PASS |
| Newsletter | PASS |
| Access to social links | PASS |
| Information about each artist | PASS |

## Deployment

In order to deploy my website I used Heroku. The deployment was made from the master branch and I did it through below steps:

 1. Firstly, we need to create a .txt file which will contain the project dependencies. Open the project in Gitpod, in the CLI run: 

 `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

 2. In Gitpod, create a file named "Procfile". Inside this file you will have to enter: 
 
 `web: python app.py`
 
 This is for Heroku to know which language the application will be running on.
 
 3. After these two steps you need to commit to Github, this is very important, otherwise Heroku will not be able to deploy the project.
 
 4. Enter the Heroku website [https://www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/), sign in with your log in credentials
 
 5. Click button "New" on the dashboard and select "Create new app".

 6. Enter an unique name of your application -> select your region -> click "Create App".
 
 7. Back on the applications dashboard in Heroku, select "Settings".
 
 8. Copy the Heroku git URL under the "App Information".
 
 9. Go back to Gitpod and into the CLI run 
 
   `git remote add heroku "Paste your Heroku Git URL here"`
 
 10. Still in the CLI, run 
 
   `heroku ps:scale web=1`
   
 11. Enter the MongoDB website [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com), sign in with your log in credentials
 
 12. When logged in and on your dashboard, select the cluster of your database and click "Connect".
 
 13. Click "Connect your application" among the options that appear.
 
 15. Choose Python as your driver and the version that you have.
 
 14. Copy the field under "Add your connection string into your application code".

 15. Go back to the Heroku website and your applications dashboard -> Click "Settings" -> Click "Reveal Config Vars".
 
 16. Click "Add" and enter the information below:

`IP` : `0.0.0.0`

`PORT`: `5000`

`MONGO_URI` : `PASTE THE CONNECTION STRING COPIED FROM MONGODB`

- IMPORTANT! Inside the connection string, replace `<password>`with your MongoDB Database access password
- IMPORTANT! Inside the connection string, replace `test` with the name of the database of your project

`SECRET_KEY` : `secret key you have entered in env.py file`

17. Click "More" in the top right corner -> Click "Restart all dynos" and confirm

18. The app is now deployed and you can open it via the button "Open App"

### Running my project locally

In order to run the project locally you should firstly enter my repository by the link https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS3-calm.
 
1. Click the button **Code**
2. Choose either **HTTPS**, **SSH** or **GitHub CLI**, then click the copy icon to the right of the link
3. You will then open the terminal in your IDE
4. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied
5. Press **Enter** and you will have created a local clone in your IDE

You could also have it open directly in Gitpod if you are using it, see below:

1. Open the repository https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS3-calm
2. Click the green **Gitpod** button 
3. Gitpod will now open up a new workspace with the code from this project

After these basic steps you will have to take further steps in order to make your IDE run the project. This is mainly instructions for Gitpod as that is the IDE that I was using. The steps might have to be adjusted depending on the IDE you use.

1. To be able to run the application, you will have to create a .txt file with all the dependencies. To do this you can simply run below command in the CLI:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

2. Create a "env.py" file, which you should add to your .gitignore as it will contain security information.

3. In order to run this project locally you will have to create a matching DB in Mongo DB.
 
4. Create a new database called "calm" with the collections: 
- "genres" 
- "artists"
- "users"
- "newsletters"

5. Choose Python as your driver and the version that you have.
 
6. Copy the field under "Add your connection string into your application code".

7. Open your env.py in your IDE and enter this information in this order from top to bottom:

`import os`

`os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")`

`os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")`

`os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "replace this with your own secret key")`

`os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI","your mongo URI copied in step 6, replace < password > with your MongoDB Database access password. replace < test > with the name of the database of your project")`

`os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "calm")`

8. Save the file and it should be ready to run locally.
